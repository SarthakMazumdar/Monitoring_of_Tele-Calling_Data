# Monitoring_of_Tele-Calling_Data

About 36 lakh consumers are billed every month. Of this, there are approximately 2.5 lakh defaulters. The defaulters need to be called and a limiting number of calls is set every month based on available manpower, number of defaulters, total outstanding amount and many other factors. The data thus generated remains valid for 20 days, after which it is frozen and archived. This data is sent to the third party call centers where the tele-calling operation is carried out. The tele-calling operation lasts for 20 days. Not all defaulters are called due to the limited number of calls. Calling should be dropped if the consumer pays the necessary amount. The dashboard reflects the entire activity from transferring data to call centers, to monitoring the outstanding amount. It makes managing and working with the data easier.
